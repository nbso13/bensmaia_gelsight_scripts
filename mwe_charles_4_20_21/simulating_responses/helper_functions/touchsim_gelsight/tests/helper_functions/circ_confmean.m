function t = circ_confmean(alpha, xi, w, d, dim)
%
% t = circ_mean(alpha, xi, w, d, dim)
%   Computes the confidence limits on the mean for circular data.
%
%   Input:
%     alpha	sample of angles in radians
%     [xi   (1-xi)-confidence limits are computed, default 0.05]
%     [w		number of incidences in case of binned angle data]
%     [d    spacing of bin centers for binned data, if supplied 
%           correction factor is used to correct for bias in 
%           estimation of r, in radians (!)]
%     [dim  compute along this dimension, default is 1]
%
%   Output:
%     t     mean +- d yields upper/lower (1-xi)% confidence limit
