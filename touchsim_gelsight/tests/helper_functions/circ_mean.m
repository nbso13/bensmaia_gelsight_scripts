function [mu ul ll] = circ_mean(alpha, w, dim)
%
% mu = circ_mean(alpha, w)
%   Computes the mean direction for circular data.
%
%   Input:
%     alpha	sample of angles in radians
%     [w		weightings in case of binned angle data]
%     [dim  compute along this dimension, default is 1]
%
%     If dim argument is specified, all other optional arguments can be
%     left empty: circ_mean(alpha, [], dim)
%
%   Output:
%     mu		mean direction
%     ul    upper 95% confidence limit
%     ll    lower 95% confidence limit
