function r = circ_r(alpha, w, d, dim)
% r = circ_r(alpha, w, d)
%   Computes mean resultant vector length for circular data.
%
%   Input:
%     alpha	sample of angles in radians
%     [w		number of incidences in case of binned angle data]
%     [d    spacing of bin centers for binned data, if supplied 
%           correction factor is used to correct for bias in 
%           estimation of r, in radians (!)]
%     [dim  compute along this dimension, default is 1]
%
%     If dim argument is specified, all other optional arguments can be
%     left empty: circ_r(alpha, [], [], dim)
%
%   Output:
%     r		mean resultant length
